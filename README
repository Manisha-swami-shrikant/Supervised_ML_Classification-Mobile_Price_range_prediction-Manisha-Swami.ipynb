In the competitive mobile phone market, understanding the relationship between phone features and their price ranges is crucial for making strategic decisions. This project aims to uncover these relationships by classifying mobile phones into price ranges based on their features, such as RAM and internal memory.

Objective: Our primary goal is to analyze how various features influence mobile phone prices, without predicting exact prices but rather categorizing them into price ranges. This approach helps manufacturers, retailers, and stakeholders make informed decisions and optimize their strategies.

Key Components:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand and visualize the dataset to uncover initial insights.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for modeling, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features that enhance model performance.
Model Building: Implement and evaluate various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost.
Evaluation: Assess model performance with an emphasis on class imbalance and robustness.
Approach: We selected the most suitable machine learning algorithms by evaluating their performance on the dataset. The models were tested for their ability to handle class imbalance and provide reliable predictions. The project utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using classification algorithms to predict mobile phone price ranges. By focusing on data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, we achieved robust predictions. The insights gained can guide manufacturers in feature and pricing decisions, help retailers optimize inventory, and assist consumers in understanding price determinants. This work highlights the practical application of machine learning in the mobile phone industry and sets the stage for future advancements in price range prediction.
